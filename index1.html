        <img src="water.jpg"/>
        <p>The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) drinking water supply will be suspended in Tondiarpet and Royapuram 
            zones (zones 4 and 5) from October 16 to 18 owing to the subway construction work near Royapuram railway 
            station and the yearly pipeline replacement work carried out by the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and 
            Sewerage Board (CMWSSB). As per the announcement, the water supply will be stopped from 10 am on October 16.

            The water supply will be restored around 6 am on October 18. During the 48-hour period, water will be distributed 
            through water lorries and trucks. This service is also extended to areas without piped drinking water supply and 
            for areas which experience low water pressure</p>

        <img src="vijay.jpg"/>
        <p>The Tamil Nadu government stuck to its stand regarding the early morning shows for Vijay’s latest movie Leo and 
            said that shows will only be allowed from 9 am instead of 7 am. This comes days after the state government revoked 
            permission for special early morning shows. Now, Leo will have five shows in Tamil Nadu which will begin at 9 am. 
            Leo is directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj starring Vijay, Trisha, Priya Anand, Mysskin, among others and is releasing on 
            October 19. </p>

        <h3>Bigg Boss Tamil season 7 triggers social media debate on education, caste, privilege</h3>
        <img src="bigg boss.jpg"/>
        <p>Jovika, one of the youngest contestants in this season of Bigg Boss, suggested that the contestants’ personal 
            discussions (that are not broadcast on the show) should not be shared in front of everyone. She said, “On the 
            first day when we were introducing ourselves, what I said about my education was not to impose my decision on anyone. 
            I am 19 and what happened has happened and I do not wish for it to be discussed by everyone.” </p>

        <h3>Lionel Messi Double Gives Argentina 2-0 Win Over Peru</h3>
        
        <p>Lionel Messi became the all-time top scorer in South American World Cup qualifying on Tuesday after netting both goals in Argentina’s 2-0 win over Peru in Lima.

            Messi, who was included in the squad despite having been sidelined in recent weeks with a muscle problem, came on as a substitute in Thursday’s 1-0 win over Paraguay but was on the pitch from the start of the game in Lima.
            
            The 36-year-old put the world champions ahead in the 32nd minute with a superb shot after an assist from Nicolas Gonzalez, and made it 2-0 10 minutes later with a fierce finish from Enzo Fernandez’s pass.</p>
